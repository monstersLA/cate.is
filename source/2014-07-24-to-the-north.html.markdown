We arrived in Oslo on a crisp snowy evening. Tumbling out of the airport with my oversized luggages, the cold northern air hit my face with a faint smell of fresh cut wood. “There are few cities like this one”, I remembered from _[the book](http://www.amazon.com/Norway-Culture-essential-customs-culture/dp/1857333314/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1405233464&sr=1-1&keywords=norway+culture)_, “where protected forest covers fifty percent of its region”. Oslo to me, felt more like a peaceful town than a buzzing capital city. A voice in my head screamed: “Scandinavia, Cate! Finally, you've travelled as far north as you've ever been!”

I had wanted to visit the very north of the globe: some day I would love to visit the north pole. Having lived in San Francisco for the past six years, I saw no snow. I longed for the cold winters when I could bundle myself up with a heavy coat and thick scarves. Plus, the boyfriend had been telling me his fond memories of his native land. Although he dreaded to visit during Christmas.

“Argh, it’s going to be boring. Why would anyone want to visit here this time of year?” He complained as we drove from the airport to downtown Oslo. I pretended not to hear him. Staring out of the window, I was too busy hoping for an elk or moose jumping onto the freeway.

The drive from Oslo airport to downtown took around 40 minutes. By the time we got to the city center, snow had turned into grey slush.  I lugged my bags across a narrow street while failing to skip some icy puddles in my Californian flats. We checked in our _[Airnbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/700732)_ : a tiny rectangle studio space with a floor heated bathroom, a book shelf full of language and travel books, and an old 90s stereo system that has too many dials and buttons. Endless Norwegian flew out of the speakers as I turned on the radio.

I've always liked how Norwegian sounds. Every time when the boyfriend tells a stories to his other Norwegian friend, the combination of tones sound so adorable and sometimes even amusing. I looked up and found the term “_[pitch accent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_accent)_”. So each word has a part where you need to stress. Depending on where the emphasis you place, the word could mean different things. Though it's not as complicated as other tonal languages like Chinese.

The written Norwegian has two forms: Bokmål _[1]_ and Nynorsk _[2]_. Most people use Bokmål, which is under heavy influence of Danish. Then during the 1850s, linguist _[Ivar Aasen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivar_Aasen)_ journeyed up the mountains in the middle and north of the country to study dialects, in attempt to create a new language that is free of the Danes. Nynorsk was born, and it's being used by 10-15% of the population. Here is a "Did you know": Norway was under the ruling of Denmark for centuries and later on of Sweden. It wasn't until 1905 when they finally gained their _[independence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_union_between_Norway_and_Sweden)_. I always thought Norway had been an old country on their own. Being able to retain this independent spirit is probably why Norway rejected to be part of the European Union.

Language in general though, is always easier to pick up when you are emerged in the environment. The second day while we were sitting at [Grünerløkka Bakeri](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gr%C3%BCnerl%C3%B8kka+Bakeri+og+Kaffehus/@59.9199463,10.7595474,18z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x46416e67aa752cfb:0xd82904417e3c250e) having a late breakfast, I ear dropped into a conversation next table. I noted down the sound of those words in my head and asked the boyfriend to explain the meaning: words such as “Morn!”, which generally means morning, but somehow you can use it as an informal way of saying hi; “Ha det” as goodbye, “Vær så god” as you are welcome, “Takk for maten” — thank you for the food etc. I began to imagine myself speaking fluent Norwegian and being on the national television for a talk show.

Anyways, for the next two days in between heavy rains, we explored the city like a proper tourist. Downtown Oslo is small enough so we walked everywhere, starting from our base camp Grünerløkka — an once industrialized neighborhood that has become hip in recent years, full of young professionals and artists. You can easily spot old factory buildings in the area. Along river Akerselva, we found wonderful parklands like Sofienbergparken. That particular winter afternoon, warm hues of the sun fell gently onto those naked tree branches and the city felt calm and content. I wondered if this was one of the reasons people up here live average longer lives.

A couple of streets away sits a small coffee roastery called Tim Wendelboe _[3]_. The cafe is known for its craft in sourcing and making good coffee. Michellin star restaurants like _[Maeemo](http://maaemo.no/)_ and _[Noma](http://noma.dk/)_ serves it too. And obviously, to combat jet lags on such high latitude is to drink coffee heavily like the locals. This Nordic country consumes so much coffee (5 cups a day) that they rank the third in the world. I ordered the samplers on the menu: six cups of black coffee. Each was brewed with beans from different regions and by _[the barista](http://instagram.com/seffsteff)_ with an Aeropress [4]. It's been too long for me to remember the origins of the beans. What I couldn't forget though, was the smoothness and the particular cup with flavor similar to Earl Grey tea. Coffee, just like tea, could have such diverse tastes. 

*“I’ve noticed, dear Neighbour, a curious effect of these roasted beans. I’ve seen many a Wife and Daughter sitting so still and so proper at Gatherings, as if they were in Church. But, as soon as this roasted Devil’s Brew crosses their lips, their mouths start chattering like Pepper Mills. And not only that, Neighbour, after three or four saucers [people would—and some places still do—pour their coffee onto the saucer to cool it] of it, they are overcome with a desire to play Cards; I’ve seen this again and again, so there has to be some Wretchedness in those very Beans.”*

What _[Nordic Coffee Culture](http://nordiccoffeeculture.com/about-nordic-coffee-culture/)_ described was accurate: “*As a rule, the conversation doesn't really start flowing before we had few sips.*” I spoke faster and became more curious of the city as we crossed the river for the food hall _[Mathallen](http://www.visitoslo.com/en/activities-and-attractions/shopping/?TLp=583195&Mathallen-Food-Hall)_. There, I discovered the typical Norwegian Christmas food — enter the age of Vikings where all you eat is meat, fish and more meat. Just kidding, but mountains, wilderness and fjørds are the reason local diets are full of reindeer, elk, lamb and fresh seafood. The Norwegian people have been relying on food from natural resources for centuries.

We walked around to find out what each stand was offering. Everything shared expensive price tags. I saw dried salty lamb sticks called _[Pinnekjøtt](http://norwegianfoodillustrated.blogspot.com/2009/12/pinnekjtt.html)_, it literally translate to *stick meat*. As a means for preserving meat for harsh winters in the old days, Norwegian people kept the entire animal and use different body parts for different purposes so nothing went to waste. Eventually the preserving process evolved and resulted as Pinnekjøtt. The long cooking process for this dish involves soaking them in water for up to 30 hours for rehydration, place them on birch sticks to place on the bottom of the pot, add in water, then cook them for 3 hours on low heat. It's usually served with steamed vegetables, or with more sausages, if you like. 

Then there is the stinky delicacy lutefisk — the lye processed whitefish is typically baked or boiled. You would eat it with bacon chunks and pour fat all over. It has the worst smell when it's being cooked. But as I placed a piece on my plate, I couldn't really taste anything bad. It didn't have much taste, just jelly like texture. We saw more Ribbe, the roasted pork belly is one of the must eats for Christmas. There was so much rich and hearty food for winter times. I took a sip from the cup of hot non-alcoholic Gløgg in my hand, and sank into the mood for a proper white Christmas, at least I was hoping for. 

For the remaining time, we continued to the waterfront. As we walked from Bjøvika — where the opera house and barcode project are, to Aker Bryggy, we spotted the Norwegian Prime Minister giving a speech on Mandela's passing at Nobel Peace Center. I then made a funny face for the photo with the guard at the Royal Palace, and checked out Karl Johan Gate's Christmas market, including a cosy Sami [5] tent.

We left Oslo on a raining morning by train. It was an unexpected warm for a December. It should’ve snowed by now. For the next two weeks of our stay in Sarpsborg, endless rain and wind took over. I slipped into a lazy habit of sleeping until noon — the same time daylight seemed to appear, eating festive food, drinking black coffee and sleeping again. Time seemed had slowed down so much. It was time to fly back to San Francisco.
